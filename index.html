  <p>One of my favorite memories growing up was building snowmen! I grew up in Michigan, USA. Winter's in Michigan were typically spent playing in the snow, snowflakes falling around us. I wanted to recreate this atmosphere in P5.js. I used random fuctions to simulate the different shapes, and speeds to snow falling. I used for loops to make the snow regenerate at the top of the canvas as it fell. </p>
